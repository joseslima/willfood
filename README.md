Small project using MobX, Dio and Retrofit

## Before start
We make use of some packages that generate code automatically, these are responsible for
allowing data serialization `json_annotation` and more easily handling state management `mobx`
to get the generated code you should run:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

or to watch

```
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```
